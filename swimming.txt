I really like swimming. I can swim well since I was 9 years old and I really enjoy the feeling of diving into water. I feel like a fish when I dived into water and I always like to play a lay a game with my friends called get the stuff under water. So someone will throw some stuff like coins, ring into water and then we will try our best to find the stuff and take it back.
